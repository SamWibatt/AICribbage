Learned models for cribbage playing: discard, next card in count.

* More self-teaching, this is like a "semester project" for showing I can use modern AI methods.
* Construct models for two player game, see if can transfer to others
* First concept is if I have models to:
    * decide which cards to discard from hand that's dealt
        * both as dealer and non-dealer
    * decide which card to play next in count
* will sketch design in wiki
