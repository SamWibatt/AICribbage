# PYBGRX.PY - graphic interface to pybbage
# using "arcade" library from https://arcade.academy/index.html
#
# Purpose:
# To experiment and develop a graphical cribbage game that can be ported to small systems like Arduino / 320x240 LCD
# And possibly to fancy glossy version like Gold Fish 3 but for cribbage

# basing this on the sprite_move_keyboard.py example, will just hack up from there

"""
Move Sprite With Keyboard

Simple program to show moving a sprite with the keyboard.
The sprite_move_keyboard_better.py example is slightly better
in how it works, but also slightly more complex.

Artwork from http://kenney.nl

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.sprite_move_keyboard
